See Makefile, check
    CC
    CFLAGS
    PERL
are correct. Then do
    make
It should work on Linux, Solaris, Mac OS X.

If mkstemp is not in the library, comment out
#define OVERWRITE in config.h

To make Perl module, do
    make perl
it creates NKF.mod. Or you can perform standard 
     perl Makefile.PL; make
in NKF.mod. It should work above Perl 5. Perl 5.6 or Perl 5.8
is checked.

You can do test,
  make test 
both in here and NKF.mod.
